# Hello MLSC Team!
Welcome to my github repo, i have been expecting you. If your seeing this repo i must tell you that this one is an outdated version, here is the updated one https://github.com/L3xtor/Skybot. IT is owned by me and a friend of mine in another country.<br><br>

But still let me tell you more about this bot. This is a discord bot coded in python and i made it when i was in 12th. It uses features such as discord's API, image manipulation (if you see the updated repo) and more!
